1. Implement graph with multiple connections between nodes,  just like in real world where there can be multiple ways to go from one way to another, or multiple ways of performing the same action
2. In the implementation of dijikstra's algorithm use min heap to store the children of a node according to their distance from the node
3. Test and debug the min_heap and max_heap code files. There are changes required in how data is stored.
